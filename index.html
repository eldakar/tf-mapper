            <p>
                This software was created as a prototype tool to add mapper functionality to one of the best MUD clients
                <a href='http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net' target='_blank'>tiny-fugue</a> by Ken Keys.
            </p>

            <p>
                The core objectives were to provide an application that easily integrates (and not only into
                tiny-fugue), works cross platform and is usable whether user client is local or remote.
            </p>

            </h3>
            </h3>

            <p>On <strong>MacOs</strong> and <strong>Windows</strong> tf-mapper is available as a compiled executable,
                all that's required is a double click. On <strong>Linux</strong> you need to take care of dependencies
                on your own; these dependencies are: Qt4.8, PyQt4 and Python 2.7 - these should all be easily available
                from your package manager.</p>

                        class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>tf integration</h3>
            </h3>

            <p>
                To integrate with any MUD client you will need to take care of scripting with accordance to our little
                'communication protocol'. We have one files prepared ready for you that has been tailored to our map for
                one of the most popular polish MUDs <a href='http://arkadia.rpg.pl' target="_blank">Arkadia LpMUD</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Sample integration: <a href='https://gist.github.com/thornag/6304395' target='_blank'>map.tf</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are generally 2 types of command that tf-mapper supports; these are teleport/lookup and navigate.
                While teleport/lookup is quite straight forward as it will simply activate the room by given roomId the
                navigate set of command are a bit more complex. You can navigate in 3 different ways (the end effect is
                the same, just how you get there differes slightly).

            </dl>
            </p>

            <h3>
                <a name="communication" class="anchor" href="#communication"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Communication
            </h3>
            </h3>

            <p>
                Communication between your client and tf-mapper is realised over TCP socket. Mapper will automatically
                (unless forced not to do so) bind a listening server on port 23923. You will then have to connect your
                MUD client to localhost:23923 - in tinyFugue we've used the background world/socket support to realise
                this communication. If your client is installed remotely (ie you are using a shell account) you should
                simply configure a reverse tunnel back to localhost:23923.
            </p>

            <p>
                tf-mapper also sends messages to your MUD client. It will for example notify you of what roomId you are
                entering, whether it has custom exits (so you can bind them to keys) or send any other arbitrary
                message.
            </p>
